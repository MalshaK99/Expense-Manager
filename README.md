This is a group project developed for the Advanced Programming Techniques course during the 3rd year, 1st semester. We have created an Expense Manager web application, here are the frontend and backend parts of our project. I have created the front end of the user profile using React and the back end using Django.

This project includes features like signup, login, logout, add expenses, delete expenses, update expenses, profile management and many more.
