This is a group project developed for the Advanced Programming Techniques course during the 3rd year, 1st semester. We have created an Expense Manager web application, here are the frontend and backend parts of our project. We have created the front end of the user profile using React and the back end using Django.

This README briefly overviews the module and instructions for getting started. Node modules and env files are deleted because of the size. So first you need to install node modules and env to run this project.
